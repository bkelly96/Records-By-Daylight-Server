Hi! Thanks for downloading my Custom DBD Packs!

In order to add them to your game you must first go to -

>  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight\DeadByDaylight\Content\UI\Icons\CharPortraits <

Once inside the CharPortraits folder just drop in everything from inside the Cute Survivors Pack to replace your survivors
and drop everything from inside the CuteKillersPack to replace your killers!

It's as simple as that! Once you've replaced every file then the next time you boot up Dead By Daylight in character selection screens will display the
provided custom icons!

Thank you!

p.s No you cannot get banned for using these.
